  <h2> Defining Theatre </h2>

<p style = "font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px;"> The theatre is a collaborative
    form of performing art that uses live performers
    to present the exeprience of a real or imagined event before a live audience
    in a specific place, often a stage. The performers may communicate this
    experience to the audience through cominations of gesture, speech, song,
    music and dance. </p>

<h1 class="attemptone"> Using a style sheet </h1>
<p class="attemptone"> Here i am trying to use the style sheet to style the webpage.
   This style won't apply to all p elements, but to the elements that i add the
   specific selector tag to. I will change the font, color, and background color
   of this text, and of the above heading </p>

<p> To each p element I will add italics to so that i can practice the other way
    of adding to a style sheet. I will also add borders to all p elements. To
    change the width of the border just place how many pixels wide you want it
    before "solid". </p>
<p class="update"> (UPDATE: i have changed this because the borders around
    all the P elements were pissing me off)</p>

<p class="border"> To just this paragraph I will add some padding, this is also
    done using a style sheet. But this paragraph will still have all other elements
    that i added to the p element in the style sheet </p>

<p class="leftborder"> This paragraph will have padding on the left. This will
   indent the writing to the right of the border. To add padding to the right,
   use the property: "padding-right". Other properties you can use here include:
   "padding-top" and "padding-bottom". </p>

<p class="align"> To change the alignment of the content you use the text-align
   property. In this case i will align the text to the centre. This is done
   in the stylesheet. Other properties you can include here: left, justify,
  right, inherit. </p>

<p class="margin"> Margins generate space around an element, outside of any paddings and borders.
    To change the margin on all four sides of an element, we use the margin
    property. </p>

<p class="topmargin"> To change the margin at the top of an element, use the
   margin-top property, you can also change the bottom of the margin with
   margin-bottom. Determine the size of the margin using pixels. In this example
   the top margin is 15px and the bottom is 50px. </p>

<p class="marginside"> You can also determine the size of the margins on either
   side in the exact same way; using eiher margin-left or margin-right. In this
   example both left and right margins will be set to 70px </p>

<p> Although they are similar, margins and the paddings are different. The
    padding adds space between the content and the border, while the margin
    adds space between the border and other elements. </p>

<h1 class="heading"> Adding padding with one line </h1>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/padding.png" class="paddingimg">
<p class="oneline"> Above you can learn how to add padding that can require four
   lines of code. You can learn to add it using one line, like this. Each element
   has four padings counted clockwise from top to right, to bottom, to left.
   When you don't want to add padding to one side, add "0" and leave out "px".
</p>


<h1 class="stylingcorners"> Styling Corners with one line. </h1>
<p class="stylingcorners"> You can set margin and border-radius shorthands with
    one line, just like above with padding. The border-radius property with four
    values rounds corners in a clockwise direction starting from top-left. Examples
    follow below with cat images </p>

<h1> Rotating Elements </h1>
   <br>
<p class="rotate"> This is how to rotate elements! </p>
   <br>
<p class="rotateone">It uses the transform property; it accepts fucntions as values. </p>
<br>

<h1> Bluring Elements </h1>
<p> This uses the filter property which can use a few different functions,
    including blur (n.px). The higher the pixels, the more blurry the
    element </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/beer.png" class="blurr"  >
<p class="blur"> I'm so drunk, everything is blurry... </p>
<br>

<h1> Graying out Images </h1>
<p> This also uses the filter property. Graying out images uses a fucntion called
    grayscale (). Setting it to 0% means it doesn't affect the image. </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Grayscale.png" class="grayscale">
<p> The opacity fucntion changes how visible elements are. The lower the opacity,
    the less visible images become. This function is also used with the filter
    property. Opacity means not see-through, setting it to 100% makes it visible.
    Opacity and grayscale work on a lot of different elements. </p>
<img src= "/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Opacity.png" class="opacity" >
<br>

<h1> Building Filters </h1>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Saturate.png" class="buildingfilters">
<p> Learning to combine contarst, brightness, and saturation to buld unique
    filters for images, continuing to use the filter property, and setting it
    to brightness(100%) changes how bright an image is; 100% is the default. </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Saturate.png" class="bright" >
<p> Setting filter to saturate(xx) adjusts how vivid the colors are. Make images
    less colorful by coding saturate(50%). </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Saturate.png" class="saturate">
<p> Setting filter to contrast(xx) adjust the difference between light and
    dark parts of an image; the lower the number, the grayer the image </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Saturate.png" class="contrast">
<p> We can add multiple functions to filter by coding them one after the other.
    For exaggerated effects you can set the functions to values over 100%. </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/Saturate.png" class="combiningfilters">
<br>

<h1> Customising Gradients </h1>
<p class="gradient"> Start with the background property and set it to the
   linear-gradient function.To gradually change the background from top to bottom,
   place colors inside the parenthese, you can add more than two colors. </p>
<p class="gradientwo"> To rotate a gradientby 90degrees, or from left to right,
   place 90deg before the colors. The direction of a gradient goes clockwise from
  0 to 360. </p>

<div>
<h1> Styling Groups of Elements </h1>
<p> You can group elements together using the div tag and then style this group
    using the stylesheet, and div as the selector tag </p>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/smile.png" class="smilesize">
</div>
<br>

<div>
<h1> Parent and child elements </h1>
<p> Everything in html is considered a box within a box, when we add a div
    element, we put a bigger box around other boxes. Because the div has another
    element nested inside it, we call it a parent element. The elements inside
    are called child elements. When we style a parent element, there are some
    properties which only affect the parent, like border, padding and margin.
    But other properties, like color, are transferred to the child elements from
    their parent. When a child element recieved a property from its parent, we
    cann this inheritance. </p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="override">
<h1> Using classes for layout </h1>
<p>  You can set classes for different div elements, you can also set classes for
     child elements. These are two examples of how to override the general div
     style sheet. This can be helpful when you want a certain similarity for all
     div elements, but you also want to style certain aspects of individual div
     elements slightly differently.
</div>
<br>

<div class="hex">
<h1> Adding color with Hex Values </h1>
<p> You can style elements with colors using hex codes, which consist of 6 letters
    and/or numbers. There are over 16 million combinations. When styling with
    hex values, put # infront of the six values, for example #000000 is black.
</p>
</div>
<br>

<div>
<h1> Setting Size with percentages </h1>
<p class="size"> Setting the size of elements using absolute vaues, like 200px, means they
    are the exact same size on any screen. We can size an element relative to its
    parents using a percentage. For example setting the width of a paragraph to
    50% will take  up  50% of the width of the parent element; in this case the
    div element </p>
</div>

<div>
<h1> Combining Multiple Classes </h1>
<p class="bold italic color"> To combine styles, we add multiple classes to an
    HTML element, without touching the CSS style sheet. Three classes have been
    combined here in the paragraph element and this looks like this: class="bold
    italic color" inside the p element. Multiple classes let us create combinations
    of different styles inside our HTML.  </p>
</div>

<div>
<h1> Grouping Selectors </h1>
<p>  Sometimes we want to apply the sampe properties across multiple elements.
     Like setting the same font-family for all buttons and paragraphs. Instead
     of writing a new rule for each element, we can use a comma to style h1 and
     button elements using the same rule. "h1, p" is called a group selector
     since it groups different elements under one rule. You can add selectors
     of any type, for example: "div, .size". </p>
</div>

<div class="widediv">
<h1> Displaying Elements </h1>
   Normal flow is the way elements display on a webpage by default. For example,
   headings and paragraphs appear on their own line while links and buttons
   get grouped on the same line. The <strong> display </strong> property
   decides whether or not an element appears on the same line.
<h3> Display: inline; </h3>
   Examples of inline elements include: a, em, strong, and li. They all appear on
   the same line when coded after each other. If multiple inline elements don't fit
   inside the width of their parents, the elements towards the end move down to the
   next line. You can't change the size of these.

<h3> Display: block; </h3>
    Elements like p, div or h3 work differently in normal flow than inline elements
    They always appear on seperate lines. The display value for elements taking
    the entire width of their parent element is <strong> block. </strong>
<h3> Display: inline-block; </h3>
    Buttons and images are displayed differently than inline or block elements,
    they have <strong> inline-block </strong> as their default <strong> display
    </strong> value.  Inline-block puts elements on the same line, while also
    letting us change their size.
<br> <br>
   We can set an element's display property to a different value when we
   want to change how they look and behave on a webpage. For example by default
   the em element has an inline value meaning you cannot change it's size, but
   as you can see below, this can be chnaged.
<br> <br>
<p> The <em class="elementdisplaychange"> drop </em> </p>
</div>

<div>
<h1> Floating Images </h1>
<img src="/Users/fredzio/Documents/Coding/wrap.png" class="wrap">
<p> Learning how to wrap text around images. To make text wrap around an image,
    first place an element with text below an image, and then, on the image, we
    set the float property to either left or right. </p>
<br>

<p class="nowrap"> If we don't want the next text element to wrap around the image,
    we set the element's clear property to the same value as the img element,
    in this case,"right".
</div>

<div>
<h1> Relative positioning </h1>
<h3> Learning to position elements relative to their original position. </h3>
<p> We can change the position of elements using the position property. When
    you set position to relative, you change an element's position in relation
    to its original position in normal flow. <p>
<p> You can push the element from the <strong class="position"> top </strong>
    of its original position. </p>
<br>
<p> Besides "top", you can use "right", "bottom" and "left" properties to place
  elements exatly where we want. </p>
</div>

<div class="absolute" >
<h1> Absolute Position </h1>
<p> To place an element at a particular spot on the screen, we set "position"
    to absolute. To put the element on the right, we use "right: 0px;". This means
    that the element is 0px away from the right side of the page. You can use "top"
    "bottom", "right" or "left" properties for positioning. This property takes
    the element completley out of normal flow, and can even overlap with other
    elements </p>.
</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<div>
<h1> Z-index </h1>
<h3> Learning how to control overlapping elements. </h3>
<p> Setting an image to "position: absolute;" takes it out of its normal follow
, so in the example below, the heading acts like the image is not there anymore,
causing overlap. We can control how images overlap with a property called z-index;
its default value is 0. As the default z-index is 0 for all elements, the browser
puts the image infront because its the first element in this example. To place an
element behind another, we set z-index to a lower number, in this case to -1.
Elements with the higher z-index number are always in front, so you can also give
the element you want infront a higher z-index number. You can do this with more
than two elements too. </p>
